§§ blurb

Hyde is configured using one or more `yaml` files. On top of all
the niceties `yaml` provides out of the box, hyde also adds a few
power features to manage complex websites.

If a site has a `site.yaml` file in the root directory it is used
as the configuration for generating the website. This can be
overridden by providing a command line option. See the
[command line reference][commandline] for details.

## Inheritance

Configuration files can inherit from another file using the
`extends` option.

For example, the following configuration will inherit all properties
from `site.yaml` and override the `mode` property.

~~~yaml~~~
extends: site.yaml
mode: production
~~~~~~~~~~

This is useful for customizing the site to operate in different modes.
For example, when running locally you may want your media files to
come from `/media` but on production you may have a subdomain and want
the media to come from `http://abc.example.com/media`.

This can be accomplished by creating an _extended_ configuration file and
overriding the `media_url` property. For a real world example, you can take
a look at the [source of this documentation][hydedocpages].

## Paths & Urls

The following path & url properties can be defined for use in templates:

`media_root`
:   The root path where media files(images, css, javascript etc.,)
    can be found. This may be used by plugins for special processing.
    If your website does not have a folder that contains all media,
    you can safely omit this property.

    _Optional_. Default: `media`

`media_url`
:   The url prefix for serving media files. If you are using a CDN like
    Amazon S3 or the Rackspace cloud and host all your media files from
    there, you can make use of this property to specify the prefix for
    all media files.

    _Optional_. Default: `/media`

`base_url`
:   The base url from which the site is served. If you are hosting the
    website in a subdomain or as part of a larger website, you can specify
    this property to indicate the path of this project in your website.

    _Optional_. Default: `/`

`deploy_root`
:   Where the generated files should go. This can either be a relative
    path from the root of the site source or an absolute path. Note that
    this can also be overridden in the [command line][commandline] using
    the `-d` option.
    
### Extensionless URLs

To avoid generating links that end in `.html`, add this line under `plugins` in
the config file, `site.yaml`:

        - hyde.ext.plugins.urls.UrlCleanerPlugin

And append something like this to the end of `site.yaml`
(the first line should not be indented):

    urlcleaner:
        index_file_names:
            # Identifies the files that represents a directory listing.
            # These file names are automatically stripped away when
            # the content_url function is called.
            - index.html
        strip_extensions:
            # The following extensions are automatically removed when
            # generating the urls using content_url function.
            - html
        # This option will append a slash to the end of directory paths if true
        append_slash: false

## Plugins & templates

`template`
:   The template engine to use for processing the website can be specified
    in the configuration file as a python class path. Currently no other
    templates apart from `Jinja2` are supported, so the `template` setting
    is a unused at the moment.

    _Optional_. Default: `hyde.ext.templates.jinja.Jinja2Template`

`plugins`
:   Plugins are specified as list of python class paths. Events that are
    raised during the generation of the website are issued to the plugins
    in the same order as they are listed here. You can learn more about
    how the individual plugins themselves are configured in the
    [plugin documentation][plugins].

    _Optional_. Default: No plugins are loaded.

    The following configuration option would load the metadata plugin
    and the blockdown plugin and execute events in the same order.

    ~~~yaml~~~
    plugins:
        - hyde.ext.plugins.meta.MetaPlugin
        - hyde.ext.plugins.blockdown.BlockdownPlugin
    ~~~~~~~~~~~

## Context Data

The context section contains key / value pairs that are simply passed
on to the templates

_Optional_. Default: No context variables are defined.

For example, given the following configuration, the statement
`{%raw%}{{app.current_version}}{%endraw%}` in any template
will output `0.6`.

~~~yaml~~~
context:
    data:
        app:
            current_version: 0.6
~~~~~~~~~~~

## Context Data Providers

Providers are special constructs used to import data into the context.
For example, data from a database can be exported as `yaml` and imported
as a provider.

For example, consider the following snippets:

~~~yaml~~~
context:
    providers:
        versions: app-versions.yaml
~~~~~~~~~~~

~~~~yaml:app-versions.yaml~~~~
latest: 0.6
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This would import the data in `app-versions.yaml` into `context[versions]`.
This data can be used directly in templates in this manner:
`{%raw%}{{ versions.latest }}{%endraw%}`.


## Markdown

Extensions and extension configuration for markdown can be configured in the
`markdown` property. You can read about markdown extensions in
[python markdown documentation][pymarkdown].

The following configuration:

~~~yaml~~~
markdown:
    extensions:
        - def_list
        - tables
        - headerid
~~~~~~~~~~

will use the def_list, tables and headerid extensions in python markdown.
