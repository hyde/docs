§§ blurb
Hyde is a static website generator written in python. While Hyde took
life as [awesome Jekyll][Jekyll]&apos;s [evil twin][], it has since been
completely consumed by [the dark side][python] and has an
[identity of its own][hydeid].

Hyde desires to fulfill the lofty goal of removing the
[pain points][static cons] involved in creating and maintaining
[static websites][static pros].
§§ /blurb

## Spotlight

*   Support for powerful template languages like [Jinja2][] complemented
    with custom tags and filters.
*   Rich [object model][] and
    overridable hierarchical [metadata][] thats available for use in
    templates.
*   Configurable [sorting, tagging and grouping][sorter] support.
*   Extensible [plugin architecture][plugins] with text preprocessing and HTML
    postprocessing support for complex content transformations.
*   Instant preview using built-in [webserver][server] that regenerates
    content if needed.

## Install

Hyde is available on [pypi][].

※ install.html as install

{{ install.blurb }}

You can find more detailed documentation in the
[installation section][install].

## Run

After installation is successful, creating & generating your website is
extremely simple.

To create a new hyde website:

~~~sh~~~
hyde -s /path/to/your/site create
~~~~~~~~

To generate the website:

~~~sh~~~
cd /path/to/your/site
hyde gen
~~~~~~~~

※ server.html as server

{{ server.blurb }}

For all the supported options, read the
[command line documentation][commandline] or run `hyde -h`.

## Your first hyde website

Hyde uses the `basic` layout to generate your website by default. When you
view your generated website, you will see the following dummy pages:

{% import "macros.j2" as macros %}

{{ macros.render_ember(basic_template) }}


You can now continue to edit the content, layout and styles to customize it to
your needs. Please see the [templating guide][templ] to get more information.
